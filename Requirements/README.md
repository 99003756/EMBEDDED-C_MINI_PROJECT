# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

1)	Adjustment of interior lighting using PIR Motion Detection Sensor (when door is opened i.e. when motion is detected, the interior lighting will work.)

2)	Adjustment of seat using Potentiometer Sensor (By using a simple handle or knob or something of that sort we can adjust our seat) 

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:


1)	When the door is opened (motion is detected) i.e. when the input is 1, the LED will glow and the interior lighting will work properly.
When the door is closed (motion is not detected) i.e. when the input is 0, the LED will not glow and the interior lighting will not work.

2)	When the ADC value is from 0 to 1500, it will take the input as 1 and the seat will be in its normal position.
When the ADC value is greater than 3000, it will take the input as 1 and the seat will be in its maximum position.
